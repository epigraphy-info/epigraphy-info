# First International Colloquium Comparative Epigraphy

Universitat de Barcelona, 28th – 30th September 2023

## Call for Papers

The research team LITTERA is happy to announce an international colloquium on Comparative
Epigraphy, to be held on the **28th–30th of September 2023** at the **Universitat de Barcelona**.
The comparative study –both genetic and typological– of written cultures is a still incipient but
very promising methodology. This colloquium aims to assess the potential contribution of a
Comparative Epigraphy to the analysis of the numerous written cultures that were generated,
developed and, in most cases, disappeared in the Mediterranean world between the first
millennium BC and the end of the Roman empire.

The colloquium will be articulated around six thematic sections introduced by the following
lectures:

1. J. Velaza: *Why Comparative Epigraphy?*
2. I.-X. Adiego: *The written cultures of the Anatolian World*
3. M. G. Amadasi: *The written cultures of the Phoenician world*
4. M. P. de Hoz: *The written cultures of the Greek world*
5. P. Poccetti: *The written cultures of the Italian Peninsula*
6. F. Beltrán: *The written cultures of the Iberian Peninsula*

We invite communication proposals that address both the theoretical aspects of the
methodology and studies on typologies, functions, media and epigraphic forms, as well as any
other type of contribution in which the comparative method predominates. Presentations will
be 20 minutes long, followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion.

**If you would like to present at the colloquium, please email an abstract of 750/1.000 words
and a short bio to epigrafiacomparada@gmail.com by the 31st of January 2023**. A scientific
committee will analyze the proposals and communicate their acceptance before **20th of March
2023**.

If you have further questions, please email **epigrafiacomparada@gmail.com**.
