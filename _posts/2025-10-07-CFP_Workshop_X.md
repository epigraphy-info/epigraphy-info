# Call for Papers: Tenth Epigraphy.info Workshop
**University of Graz, Austria — 24–26 April 2026**


Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the **tenth Epigraphy.info workshop**, to be held in *Graz (Austria)* from **24 to 26 April 2026**. The event will be organized by the *Department of Ancient History and Epigraphy at the University of Graz*, in collaboration with the *Epigraphy.info Steering Committee*.

The tenth Epigraphy.info workshop will be dedicated to the memory of **Winfried Kumpitsch** and will feature a special thematic focus on **Sacred Spaces, Sacred Words: Digital Approaches to Religious Epigraphy,** an area to which Winfried devoted much of his scholarly work and research. Alongside this theme, the workshop will continue the established tradition of bringing together scholars, students, and practitioners of *digital epigraphy* to exchange ideas, share experiences, and develop new collaborations (see [https://epigraphy.info/](https://epigraphy.info/) for past meetings).

## Programme and Contributions

As in previous years, the workshop will consist of paper sessions, a poster session, and a variety of hands-on or training activities. We warmly welcome contributions in different formats, including:

- **Research papers** presenting projects, methodologies, or case studies *(15 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A)*.
- **Contributions to the thematic panel** on *Sacred Spaces, Sacred Words: Digital Approaches to Religious Epigraphy*:  
  This panel invites papers that explore digital approaches to religion in its broadest sense.  
  Contributions may address written objects and their associations with the sacred sphere, as well as the study of cult sites, rituals, dedications, and religious figures through digital tools and methods.  
  Papers may also examine how digital modeling, data analysis, mapping, or visualization can enhance our understanding of religious practices, networks, and spaces.  
  The aim is to highlight how digital technologies can shed new light on the material, spatial, or textual dimensions of religious experience and open new avenues for the interpretation of religion.
- **Contributions** on any other subject of relevance to the *Epigraphy.info* community.
- **Posters** highlighting new initiatives, educational activities, or updates on ongoing projects.
- **Practical sessions**, such as hackathons, demonstrations of digital tools, or training workshops.  
  Please indicate in your abstract the time you will need for your session.

## Participation

The workshop is planned as an **in-person event in Graz**, fostering direct exchange and collaboration. However, a small number of sessions, including selected keynote lectures, will also be available for **remote attendance**.  
Recordings of some presentations may subsequently be shared via the *Epigraphy.info YouTube channel*, and posters will be made accessible through the *Epigraphy.info website*, depending on the discretion of the presenters.  
Contributors are further encouraged to deposit their work on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and link it to the *Epigraphy.info* community for long-term visibility.
