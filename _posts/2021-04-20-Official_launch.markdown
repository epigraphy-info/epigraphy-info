**Valete viatores / χαίρετε, παροδῖται**!

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the **Epigraphy.info** new website!

Here you can read about the Epigraphy.info community, access the information about past and future activities and meetings, get to know individual working groups and their current aims. Most importantly, if you would like to become part of the community, you can get in touch with us. If you would like to find out about the latest developments in Digital Epigraphy, check out our Social Media activity on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and follow us!

If you are interested in the technology behind the scene, the static website is built on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) infrastructure.
