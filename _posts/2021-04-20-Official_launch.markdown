**Valete viatores / χαίρετε, παροδῖται**!

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the **Epigraphy.info** new website!
Here you can read about the Epigraphy.info community, access the information about past and future activities and [meetings]({{ "meetings/" | relative_url }}), get to know individual [working groups]({{ "working_groups/working_groups/" | relative_url }}) and their current aims. Most importantly, if you would like to become part of the community, you can [get in touch directly with us]({{ "contact/" | relative_url }}). 

If you would like to find out about the latest developments in Digital Epigraphy, check out our [Social Media]({{ "working_groups/social_media_wg" | relative_url }}) activity on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/epigraphy.info/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epigraphy_info), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/epigraphy.info/).

If you are interested in the technology behind the scene, the static website is built on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) infrastructure, stored at [Epigraphy-info GitHub](https://github.com/epigraphy-info).
