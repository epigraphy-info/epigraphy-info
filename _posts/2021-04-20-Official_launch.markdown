**Valete viatores**!

We are thrilled to announce we have launched the **Epigraphy.info** new website!

You can read about the Epigraphy.info community, access the information about past and future activities and [meetings](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link meetings %})), get to know individual [working groups and their current aims]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link working_groups/working_groups %}). Most importantly, if you would like to become part of the community, you can [get in touch with us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link working_groups/social_media_wg %}). If you would like to find out about latest developments in Epigraphy, check out our [Social Media Activity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact %}) and follow us!

If you are interested in the technology behind the scene, the static website is built on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) infrastructure.
