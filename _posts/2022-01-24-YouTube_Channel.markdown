# Epigraphy.info has its own YouTube Channel

After the 6th Epigraphy.info workshop hosted by the IAS the Social Media group created an account on YouTube. There you'll find clips about epigraphy, about databases and interviews with epigraphists.

Our very first video is showing the brilliant key lecture note given by Polly Low during the workshop.
