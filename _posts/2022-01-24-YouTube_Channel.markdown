After the **6th Epigraphy.info workshop** the Social Media group created an account on [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/c/EpigraphyInfo). We are planning to share clips about epigraphy, databases and interviews with digital epigraphists.

Our very first video is showing the brilliant **key lecture note given by Polly Low** during the workshop hosted by the IAS.
