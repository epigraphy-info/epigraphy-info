# Register for DTS Hackathon and win a prize

*(posted on behalf of Matteo Romanello and Pietro Liuzzo)*

Dear colleagues, 

we would like to remind you that registrations to the 1st online [**DTS Hackathon**](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/workshops/events/2021-hackathon/) are open until 24.09.2021 (for details, see the [registration page](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/workshops/events/2021-hackathon/#registration)).

This hackathon – funded by the *dhCenter UNIL-EPFL and the École Nationale des Chartes* – is open to DH researchers, research software developers / engineers, and more generally to anyone involved in writing code and software to publish texts online, in any language and from any period and area.

## Schedule

The hackathon will run fully online, and mostly asynchronously, between September 27 and October 10, 2021. A detailed schedule of the event can be found on the [hackathon's website](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/workshops/events/2021-hackathon/#hackathon-schedule).

## Prizes

The  contributions developed during the hackathon will be evaluated by an international jury which will award prizes in four
 categories. Category winners will be awarded a prize of their choice between the two following options:


1. [Remarkable2 e-ink reader](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2)
1. [Transkribus ScanTent + SanDisk portable SSD drive (1TB)](https://www.galaxus.ch/it/s1/product/sandisk-portable-ssd-2000gb-ssd-esterne-14967106)

## Hack ideas

For those who would like to join the hackathon but have not yet identified what to work on, we recommend you to keep an eye on the list of
[hack ideas](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/workshops/labels/Hackathon) that are being put forward. If anything catches your attention you can get in touch with the proponent, start discussing it further and eventually form a team. All collected ideas will be pitched by their proponent(s) on the first day of the hackathon.
