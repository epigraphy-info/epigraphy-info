**Dear friends of Epigraphy.info**!

We are delighted to announce that the **seventh Epigraphy.info workshop** will be taking place between *Monday April 24 and Wednesday April 26 2023 in Leuven*. Please, **save the date!**

The event will be held primarily as in-person meeting but we plan for some combination of a hybrid format for participants that would otherwise be prevented from attending.
More information about the venue, the registration and the programme will be available at Epigraphy.info website in late January 2023.

If you have an interesting project you would like to present at the conference, please contact the *Steering committee* ([info@epigraphy.info](mailto:info@epigraphy.info)) who is in charge of putting together a program of the meeting.
