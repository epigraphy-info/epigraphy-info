#“Modeling Epigraphy with an Ontology” document

If you would like to know more details or get involved in the Ontology Working Group, you can contact [Epigraphic Ontology Mailing List](mailto:epont@googlegroups.com).

The document **“Modeling Epigraphy with an Ontology”** has been published on the Epigraphy.info website. The official draft of the ‘Modeling Epigraphy with an Ontology’ document is stored in Zenodo at doi: [10.5281/zenodo.4639507](10.5281/zenodo.4639507)

The document describes how to use existing ontologies as well as a few new properties and classes, to model epigraphic objects. Inscriptions that are described using this model can be shared, ingested into an ontological database, and used in graph databases or to share linked open data. Describing an inscription in this way complements existing practices as described by EpiDoc.
