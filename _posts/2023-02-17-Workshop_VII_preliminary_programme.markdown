Dear members of the Epigraphy.info community, 

From 24-26 April 2023 the **7th Epigraphy.info workshop** will take place in Leuven (at the campus of [KU Leuvenâ€™s Faculty of Arts](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/english/contact)).

On Monday April 24th, selected participants will be able to attend 2 hands-on **training sessions** (in collaboration with the [ENCODE project](https://site.unibo.it/encode/en)) on the application of EpiDoc (with a focus on Mycenean inscriptions) and the use of the READ (Research Environment for Ancient Documents) platform for epigraphy. The afternoon session will be followed by a **poster session** (including a reception, at 16:30 CET). If you would be interested in presenting your digital epigraphy work in this format, please send a title and a short abstract to info@epigraphy.info (**deadline: March 24th**). By March 31st, you will receive a notification from the committee whether your poster proposal has been accepted. We will also offer the possibility to present your poster virtually, and during the workshop the posters will also be displayed on the Epigraphy.info website (where they can be published publicly afterwards).

The **Epigraphy.info workshop** (25-26 April) will be organized in a hybrid way and can therefore be attended online (at least all public sessions) as well as in-person. During the workshop, members of the different **working groups** (on the Epigraphic Ontologies, Vocabularies, Outreach, Ethics, Social Media, etc.) will convene to interactively discuss their progress with the community. On Tuesday April 25th, a **keynote lecture** will be followed by an (optional) **social dinner**. The morning session on Wednesday April 26th will be dedicated to the **future perspectives** of Epigraphy.info, including **community decisions** on new steering committee members and the organization of the next Epigraphy.info workshop (applications are welcome at info@epigraphy.info). In the afternoon, the organization is preparing a **social event**, in the form of a visit to a Belgian museum (including a small epigraphic collection).

We would like to encourage both experienced and early career scholars to actively participate in this event. Therefore, we are offering the opportunity to present your work in the field of digital epigraphy. If you would be interested in giving a short presentation during the event, please contact the steering committee (**deadline: February 26th**) via info@epigraphy.info.
