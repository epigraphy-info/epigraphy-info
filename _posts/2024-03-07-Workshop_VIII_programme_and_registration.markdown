*Dear members of the Epigraphy.info community and friends of digital epigraphy,*

The programme of the next **Epigraphy.info VIII workshop in Berlin (3-5 April 2024)** is officially published and registration is open until 25 March 2024.

You can access the programme [here](https://epigraphy.info/documents/workshop_8/Programme_Epigraphy_Berlin_20240226.pdf) or on the workshopâ€™s website [(https://epigraphy.info/workshop_8/)](https://epigraphy.info/workshop_8/). Some parts of the programme can be attended in a hybrid format, but registration is necessary. Due to limited seats for the Hands-on sessions, we recommend that all participants register as soon as possible. You can register through a form linked to the workshop [website](https://epigraphy.info/workshop_8/#registration).

The participation (both in-person and remote) is free of charge, thanks to the generosity of local organisers! The in-person participants will be kindly asked to cover the cost of the conference dinner on Day 1, should the wish to participate.

During the Berlin workshop, the **election of new members for the Steering Committee** will take place and the location for the next workshop will be decided. If you would like to candidate as a member of the Steering Committee or if you would like to host the next Epigraphy.info workshop, please, send your application to info@epigraphy.info.

If you would like to know more about the Epigraphy.info community before the workshop, you can join an **orientation meet-up event on 26 March 2024**, where you will get a chance to learn what Epigraphy.info is about, to familiarize yourself with the community, its activities, and how you can participate and contribute. We encourage you to participate and ask any questions you may have! Additionally, if you have specific questions or topics you'd like us to cover, please feel free to share them with us in advance at socialmedia@epigraphy.info.
