## Abstract

This workshop introduces participants to the use of **Wikidata** and its open-source software **Wikibase** for modelling, analysing, and making epigraphic data reusable (Maniero Azzolini 2024; Maniero Azzolini 2026; Thornton, Seals-Nutt, Chen 2024a; 2024b).

The session begins with an overview of Wikidata and its structure as a collaboratively edited, structured knowledge base that stores information in a machine-readable format. Wikidata provides a flexible, multilingual environment in which data can be modelled by linking items to a variety of values—such as other items, URLs, external identifiers, text strings, geographic coordinates, and quantities—through properties. This structure enables advanced querying and diverse visualisations via the Query Service.

An **Epigraphic Data Model** will then be introduced. This model provides a standardised framework for representing inscriptions in Wikidata, based on the FAIR Epigraphy Principles. During the guided activity, convenors will demonstrate how to apply the data model and show participants how to edit existing entries and add new inscriptions.

The convenors will also introduce **SPARQL queries**, illustrating how to extract structured information from Wikidata, generate lists and graphs, and visualise patterns in epigraphic corpora. Following the demonstration, participants will contribute directly by editing and creating entries for inscriptions, applying the Epigraphic Data Model in real time. Participants will work in small groups under the guidance of the convenors. Inscriptions will be selected by the convenors, though participants are also welcome to contribute their own material. Attendees will build and execute SPARQL queries to explore epigraphic datasets. This hands-on engagement allows participants to experience both the opportunities and complexities of structured data management in Wikidata.

The session will further demonstrate how to model, analyse, and make reusable epigraphic **Linked Open Data** by creating a dedicated database through the **Wikibase.cloud** platform. Wikibase.cloud is a free and accessible tool developed by Wikimedia Deutschland that allows users to define their own data models and data licenses while working in an environment similar to Wikidata.

During the practical session, participants will work on the Wikibase instance **Greek Metrical Inscriptions**, where data on Greek metrical inscriptions are being modelled using controlled vocabularies and a data model compliant with the principles of the FAIR Epigraphy Project (Ortimini 2025a; 2025b).

The session concludes with a discussion structured around three key areas: **Data Model** – challenges in representing complex epigraphic information and ways to improve accuracy and usability; **Editing** – experiences and difficulties encountered when entering inscriptions and linking entities; **Querying** – strategies for constructing effective SPARQL queries and interpreting results. This interactive session fosters collaborative problem-solving, exchange of best practices, and provides an opportunity for convenors to gather feedback and insights from participants.

## Comments

No prerequisites are required. Participants who wish to edit are encouraged to create a Wikidata account at least 24 hours in advance. The session is open to anyone interested in participating in the discussion and observing the editing and querying workflow.
