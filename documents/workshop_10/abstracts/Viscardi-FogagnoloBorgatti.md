## Abstract

The poster will present one of the results of the _LARES_ Project (_Language and Religion: Lexical
Change and Variation in Religious Enculturation / Acculturation phenomena on the Ancient World_),
a research project funded by the action Seed Funding of the UNA-Europa Network, coordinated by
the University of Bologna and built on a partnership which sees the collaboration of other European
Universities (Helsingin Yliopisto, Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie, Universidad Complutense
de Madrid). The aim of the project is to enfoster interdisciplinary approaches for the study of ancient
religions focusing on the transmission and adaptation of practices and vocabulary from and to
different cultural environments.

The product we will present on this occasion is the _[LARES Conceptual Lexicon of Religious
Acculturation in Antiquity and Late Antiquity](https://lares-lexicon.unibo.it/en/)_, a digital lexicon
encoded in EpiDoc and published through the EFES (EpiDoc Front-End services) publication
platform. The lexicon can bee seen as a conceptual and socio-cultural map of significant religious
terms and collects several entries, which analyze from a syncronical and diacronical perspective
sources mentioning them, categorized with designed markers. The markers are divided in three main
fields (representation, communication, fruition), respectively subdivided into three realms of
relevance (practice/belief/fiction, sign/meaning/speech, system/instruments/structures): a specific
markup has been created to allow searching options.

In this poster, we will show how epigraphic souces are treated in the LARES lexicon, trying to answer
some question related to the digital representation of inscriptions and religious terms contained in
them.
