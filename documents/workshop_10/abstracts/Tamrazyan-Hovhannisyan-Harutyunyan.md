## Abstract

This study examines the compatibility of Armenian editorial conventions—first codified in the _Divan Hay Vimagrutʿyan_ (Corpus of Armenian Epigraphy)—with the Leiden system and EpiDoc TEI standards. It demonstrates how Armenian epigraphy developed a systematic apparatus of editorial signs distinguishing between diplomatic and interpretative transcription and marking restorations, abbreviations, and redundancies with a high degree of philological precision. 

Through comparative analysis, the study identifies both convergences and divergences between Armenian practice and international conventions. It proposes a __dual-track encoding strategy__: one track enables a granular mapping of Armenian sigla to Leiden and EpiDoc categories to ensure interoperability; the other maintains a schema __faithful to Armenian scholarly usage and visual conventions__, preserving the integrity and historical depth of local editorial traditions.

This model allows Armenian inscriptions to be integrated into global digital infrastructures without compromising their methodological specificity. It ensures transparency, reproducibility, and long-term preservation by following FAIR data principles and demonstrates how culturally grounded editorial systems can enrich international standards in digital epigraphy.
