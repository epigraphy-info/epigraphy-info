## Poster 1 - *VALETE VOS VIATORES:* new tools for teaching and disseminating Roman epigraphy

**Javier Andreu Pintado**, Universidad de Navarra, jandreup@unav.es

*Abstract:*

As was presented in the last [Epigraphy.info workshop](https://epigraphy.info/documents/workshop_6/P5_AndreuPintado_VALETE_VIATORES.pdf), in the last two years, a consortium created by several European Universities, with the financial support of Creative Europe, has developed a project, Valete vos viatores: travelling through Latin inscriptions across the Roman Empire with an essential focus: to develop new tools and supports that contribute to highlight the role played by inscriptions in the Roman world and to use these tools as material supports for new forms of university teaching in Roman Epigraphy, among them, a large virtual repository of digitialized inscriptions, a video game, a documentary serie of four chapters explaining main goals on research in Roman Epigraphy and an open access final publication. The poster will present some of these supports as well as the website created for this purpose in case it is useful for teachers of Roman Epigraphy around the world.

## Poster 2 - Greek Metrical Inscriptions from the Imperial Age: A Website Proposal

**Pietro Ortimini**, University of Pisa

*Abstract:* 
A rich production of Greek epigraphic poetry flourished during the Imperial Age. A corpus of about 1700 Greek metrical inscriptions exhibits significant diversity in the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts, and the literary aspects. As a part of my PhD research project, I am redefining the corpus by adding inscriptions not included in the current editions. Moreover, I am collecting the data relating to the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts and the literary aspects for each inscription.
Over the next few years, I aspire to create a website where the inscriptions of the corpus are fully accessible as a single collection. The inscriptions will be placed on an interactive map, with references to the editions. The data relating to the socio-historical contexts and the literary aspects will be displayed for each inscription. The data are the following: the place of discovery, the epigraphic support, the date, the author, the clients and recipients, the literary genre, the length of the text, the type of meter. It will be also possible to carry out cross-searches thanks to a search index. The intention is to develop the website using Python and the Django web framework. The website will be HTML based, employ semantic markup based on XML, and include external links to the other epigraphy related websites. There are also plans to expand the database to include Greek metrical inscriptions from Late Antiquity (4th -6th century AD).

## Poster & Digital presentation - Linguistic Analysis in the **Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine** Project

**Christine Roughan (New York University), Christopher B. Zeichmann (Toronto Metropolitan University), Michael L. Satlow (Brown University)**

*Abstract:* 

The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine (IIP) project presents a digital corpus of inscriptions from Israel and Palestine dating between the sixth century BCE and the seventh century CE. As of April 2023, this corpus includes 5,282 inscriptions encoded in EpiDoc-compliant XML, an example of which can be seen in the XML excerpt to the right. Four languages comprise the bulk of the corpus: 2,941 of these inscriptions contain Greek, 1,739 contain Aramaic, 457 contain Hebrew, and 262 contain Latin. Other languages (Phoenician, Classical Armenian, Syriac, Arabic, and Georgian) are represented in smaller amounts.
