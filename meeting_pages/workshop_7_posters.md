## *VALETE VOS VIATORES:* new tools for teaching and disseminating Roman epigraphy

**Javier Andreu Pintado**, Universidad de Navarra, jandreup@unav.es

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

As was presented in the last [Epigraphy.info workshop](https://epigraphy.info/documents/workshop_6/P5_AndreuPintado_VALETE_VIATORES.pdf), in the last two years, a consortium created by several European Universities, with the financial support of Creative Europe, has developed a project, Valete vos viatores: travelling through Latin inscriptions across the Roman Empire with an essential focus: to develop new tools and supports that contribute to highlight the role played by inscriptions in the Roman world and to use these tools as material supports for new forms of university teaching in Roman Epigraphy, among them, a large virtual repository of digitialized inscriptions, a video game, a documentary serie of four chapters explaining main goals on research in Roman Epigraphy and an open access final publication. The poster will present some of these supports as well as the website created for this purpose in case it is useful for teachers of Roman Epigraphy around the world.

## Greek Metrical Inscriptions from the Imperial Age: A Website Proposal

**Pietro Ortimini**, University of Pisa

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

A rich production of Greek epigraphic poetry flourished during the Imperial Age. A corpus of about 1700 Greek metrical inscriptions exhibits significant diversity in the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts, and the literary aspects. As a part of my PhD research project, I am redefining the corpus by adding inscriptions not included in the current editions. Moreover, I am collecting the data relating to the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts and the literary aspects for each inscription.

Over the next few years, I aspire to create a website where the inscriptions of the corpus are fully accessible as a single collection. The inscriptions will be placed on an interactive map, with references to the editions. The data relating to the socio-historical contexts and the literary aspects will be displayed for each inscription. The data are the following: the place of discovery, the epigraphic support, the date, the author, the clients and recipients, the literary genre, the length of the text, the type of meter. It will be also possible to carry out cross-searches thanks to a search index. The intention is to develop the website using Python and the Django web framework. The website will be HTML based, employ semantic markup based on XML, and include external links to the other epigraphy related websites. There are also plans to expand the database to include Greek metrical inscriptions from Late Antiquity (4th -6th century AD).

## Linguistic Analysis in the **Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine** Project

**Christine Roughan (New York University), Christopher B. Zeichmann (Toronto Metropolitan University), Michael L. Satlow (Brown University)**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine (IIP) project presents a digital corpus of inscriptions from Israel and Palestine dating between the sixth century BCE and the seventh century CE. As of April 2023, this corpus includes 5,282 inscriptions encoded in EpiDoc-compliant XML, an example of which can be seen in the XML excerpt to the right. Four languages comprise the bulk of the corpus: 2,941 of these inscriptions contain Greek, 1,739 contain Aramaic, 457 contain Hebrew, and 262 contain Latin. Other languages (Phoenician, Classical Armenian, Syriac, Arabic, and Georgian) are represented in smaller amounts.

## When epigraphy meets linguistics. The semantic annotation of modality in the Latin inscriptions of the Republican age.

**Francesca Dell’Oro, Helena Bermúdez Sabel, Pauline Jacsont**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Modality – i.e., the expression of the notions of necessity, possibility and volition in a language – is today a thriving research field in linguistics. The WoPoss corpus is being set up and annotated with the goal of investigating modality in the history of the Latin language through literary and documentary texts. This poster outlines the new release of the WoPoss corpus, including now 74 inscriptions. This recent achievement crucially enriches the WoPoss corpus and complies with its aim of being a representative corpus in terms of sociolinguistic variables. Moreover, it enhances epigraphic research, by providing a fine-grained semantic analysis which is still rare even on literary texts.

In the poster we outline the whole pipeline along with the sequence of necessary file conversions, including the selection of the relevant Republican inscriptions to be (added and) retrieved from the EDR database, the automatic annotation of the files using the Stanza library for Python (adding lemmas, parts of speech, morphosyntactic description, and syntactic dependencies), the manual semantic annotation, the validation of the final files against the WoPoss project’s schemas and how the corpus can be accessed through the dedicated interface https://woposs.unine.ch/search. 

Acknowledgements: This new release is the result of a close cooperation between the Epigraphic Database Rome project and the SNSF-funded project A World of Possibilities (PI: Francesca Dell’Oro). It was made possible by an EAGLE-IDEA bursary granted to Mrs. Pauline Jacsont.

## EpiSearch. Epigraphic Manuscripts and Digital Humanities.

**Tatiana Tommasi**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract:</summary>

EpiSearch is a collaborative pilot project that explores the possibilities offered by technologies deployed in the field of the Digital Humanities to recover the data found in the so-called epigraphic manuscripts and to link them to the main online epigraphic databases existing today (EDR, EDH, EDCS, PHI). Epigraphic manuscripts, consisting of handwritten transcriptions made by erudites in post-classical times, are of fundamental value because they preserve the only record for textual sources that have not survived in their physical form. Despite their importance, epigraphic manuscripts have seldom received sufficient scholarly attention; moreover, until now they have never been studied through a digital approach. The EpiSearch project aims at bridging this gap.

To reach this goal the EpiSearch team is working on a case study: an epigraphic manuscript written in Venice in the early 1700s by a local antiquarian, Giovanni Antonio Astori. This study is intended as a proof of concept, in view of a future large-scale and collaborative research plan. 
The project has so far included three main steps.

The first one explores the possibilities offered by Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) to study epigraphic manuscripts.
The second encompasses designing an integrated system, created by collecting data from the main online epigraphic databases; this will give us the possibility to match the inscriptions that are transcribed in the manuscript with their edition in digital resources.
The last step will produce a digital application to browse a visually annotated version of the manuscript with hyperlinks to the online epigraphic databases for connecting the transcriptions of inscriptions with their current digital editions.

The EpiSearch team includes Federico Boschetti: Institute for Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli” – National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ILC), Pisa / Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH), Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Lorenzo Calvelli, PI: Department of Humanities and VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Franz Fischer: Department of Humanities and VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Daniele Fusi: VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Silvia Orlandi: Sapienza University of Rome; Thea Sommerschield: Department of Humanities, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Tatiana Tommasi: Department of Humanities, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice.

## EpiDoc to CIDOC CRM alignment. Towards a semantic integration of epigraphic information

**Francesca Murano & Achille Felicetti**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract:</summary>

The poster presents the definition of the mapping between the EpiDoc encoding schema and CIDOC CRM, the most relevant ontology in the field of Cultural Heritage, provided by the ItAnt project.

The project "Languages and Cultures of Ancient Italy. Historical Linguistics and Digital Models" aims to investigate the languages of Ancient Italy by combining the traditional methods, proper to historical linguistics, with methods and technologies proper to the Digital Humanities.

The languages of ancient Italy are documented almost exclusively in epigraphic texts and the creation of the first digital archive of their documentation according to the TEI/EpiDoc Guidelines is one of the main objectives of the project.

In order to foster future interoperability and integration with other external datasets, a paramount concern of the project, we are mapping the EpiDoc schema to the CIDOC CRM ontology, in particular to its CRMtex extension, an ontological model developed to support the study of ancient documents by identifying relevant textual entities and by modelling the scientific process related to their investigation and features.
CRMtex defines classes and properties for describing a handwritten text in all its aspects, from its creation in the past, down to its present conservation, investigation and study by scholars, including its transcription, translation, interpretation and publication. 

The full compatibility of CRMtex with the CIDOC CRM ontology and its extensions ensures persistent interoperability of data encoded by means of its entities with other semantic information produced in Cultural Heritage and Digital Humanities.

## Digitization of the inscriptions on the monuments of Armenian cultural heritage in Nagorno-Karabakh region

**Tamrazyan Hamest**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

As part of a series of actions coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, the Digital Humanities Institute is currently prototyping methods to offer rapid deployment of DH technology in situations of crisis when a good network of local partners can be identified and coordinated. So far, we have collected, systematized and digitized more than two hundred inscriptions from the Nagorno-Karabakh region. By documenting, digitizing and annotating these inscriptions we strive to create a single readily searchable database of Armenian inscriptions of Nagorno-Karabakh complete with the essential information about them. However, the resources and methods of Digital Epigraphy have not yet been applied to Armenian inscriptions properly. 

This project will be one of the first steps in this direction. It will help to point out the methodological issues which are specific to the application of information technologies to Armenian epigraphy. We assume that the computational approach is going to change the way Armenian epigraphy is studied, to the extent of renovating the discipline on the basis of new, unexplored questions.

## Digital epigraphy and social media for master students: the example of Linear B tablets

**Elena Duce Pastor**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

In this poster, I will present a project I am developing for the academic year 2022-2023 for master students in Antiquity. Concretely, in the subject “The Aegean in the bronze age: Minoans and Mycenaeans”. Students must study one Tablet in lineal B using online databases for bibliography and DAMOS database, which implies learning skills about digital epigraphy. Finally, they have to present their results in a Twitter file related to an official account (Antiquity from the University).

This Project implies the acquisition of digital humanities skills by students and the spread of this info to the general public. I try to teach them not only to be users of digital epigraphy but also to take into account public History.

## AGILe: the First Dedicated Lemmatizer for Ancient Greek Inscriptions 

**Evelien de Graaf, Silvia Stopponi, Jasper Bos, Saskia Peels-Matthey, Malvina Nissim**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Lemmatization (i.e. linking word forms to their lemmata) of Ancient Greek corpora is of key importance. Lemmatized texts allow for more advanced analyses, for example to easier retrieve (co)-occurrences  and collocations, since it is possible to find all inflected forms of the same lemma with only one search. Despite these advantages, most corpora of Ancient Greek inscriptions have not been lemmatized yet. To remedy this problem, we present **an automatic lemmatizer dedicated to inscriptions**, which can  achieve up to 85% accuracy. 
We first tested the performance of three available lemmatizers for ancient Greek, GLEM (Bary et al., 2017), the CLTK lemmatizer (Burns, 2020) and the UDPipe lemmatizer (Straka, 2019) on ancient Greek inscriptions. For evaluation, we used a manually lemmatized corpus, the *Collection of Greek Ritual Norms* project (Carbon et al., 2016), and compared the suggestions of these lemmatizers to the manually entered “gold” lemmata. Although reported performance of the lemmatizers on literary texts is around 90%, they perform worse (av. 46% correctness) on the CGRN, since they have been trained on, and are thus successful for literary texts, while epigraphical corpora come with specific challenges, notably,  large (dialectal) variation and spelling mistakes. 

We then created an automatic lemmatizer for inscriptions (called [AGILe](AGILe)), learning directly from epigraphic material, thanks to recent advances in machine learning. Specifically, we trained the Stanza lemmatizer (Qi et al., 2020) on the CGRN, to obtain a lemmatizer tailored to epigraphy. We were able  to increase the performance of automatic lemmatization, achieving almost 85% accuracy.

## Behind the scenes of the MAPPOLA Database

**Chiara Cenati, Alexander Gangoly, Victoria González Berdús, Peter Kruschwitz, Denisa Murzea, Rainer Simon, Paul Strobach, Mirko Tasso*

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>

At the V Epigraphy.info workshop in 2020 we presented the idea of an open-access platform  for the ERC-funded project MAPPOLA (Mapping out the poetic landscape(s) of the Roman  empire) displaying the circa 4000 Latin and Greek verse inscriptions produced in the Roman  world on an interactive map, according to various descriptors which include chronology, type  of inscription, prosopographical features, language, etc. Now, almost three years later, we would like to show to the Digital Epigraphy community the  progress we have made in the programming of the database and the technology we have  adopted. 

The database application is programmed in Python using the Flask framework. It loads and  stores data from a relational database (MySQL) which we have given a specifically designed  schema that fits our needs. We have used Eagle Vocabularies as far as possible and we have  adapted them when necessary. For the bibliography we have set up a Zotero library which will  be also extra referenced in the database. EpiDoc is used for the transcription of the epigraphic  texts. For basic tags the Patrimonium EpiDoc converter has been implemented. Different  visualizations of the diplomatic and interpretive transcription as well as the display of verse  division have been obtained in EpiDoc. 

Users will be able to display and filter the results of their search both as a list and on an  interactive map which has been implemented. The technical basis for the map is MapLibre, an  Open Source map library. Users will be able to switch between two different background layers,  a present-day map based on OpenStreetMap data from the MapTiler hosting service, and the  Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire map from the University of Gothenburg.
