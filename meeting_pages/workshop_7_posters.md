## Poster 1 - *VALETE VOS VIATORES:* new tools for teaching and disseminating Roman epigraphy

**Javier Andreu Pintado**, Universidad de Navarra, jandreup@unav.es

*Abstract:*

As was presented in the last [Epigraphy.info workshop](https://epigraphy.info/documents/workshop_6/P5_AndreuPintado_VALETE_VIATORES.pdf), in the last two years, a consortium created by several European Universities, with the financial support of Creative Europe, has developed a project, Valete vos viatores: travelling through Latin inscriptions across the Roman Empire with an essential focus: to develop new tools and supports that contribute to highlight the role played by inscriptions in the Roman world and to use these tools as material supports for new forms of university teaching in Roman Epigraphy, among them, a large virtual repository of digitialized inscriptions, a video game, a documentary serie of four chapters explaining main goals on research in Roman Epigraphy and an open access final publication. The poster will present some of these supports as well as the website created for this purpose in case it is useful for teachers of Roman Epigraphy around the world.

## Poster 2 - Greek Metrical Inscriptions from the Imperial Age: A Website Proposal

**Pietro Ortimini**, University of Pisa

*Abstract:* 
A rich production of Greek epigraphic poetry flourished during the Imperial Age. A corpus of about 1700 Greek metrical inscriptions exhibits significant diversity in the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts, and the literary aspects. As a part of my PhD research project, I am redefining the corpus by adding inscriptions not included in the current editions. Moreover, I am collecting the data relating to the geographical, socio-historical, archaeological contexts and the literary aspects for each inscription.
Over the next few years, I aspire to create a website where the inscriptions of the corpus are fully accessible as a single collection. The inscriptions will be placed on an interactive map, with references to the editions. The data relating to the socio-historical contexts and the literary aspects will be displayed for each inscription. The data are the following: the place of discovery, the epigraphic support, the date, the author, the clients and recipients, the literary genre, the length of the text, the type of meter. It will be also possible to carry out cross-searches thanks to a search index. The intention is to develop the website using Python and the Django web framework. The website will be HTML based, employ semantic markup based on XML, and include external links to the other epigraphy related websites. There are also plans to expand the database to include Greek metrical inscriptions from Late Antiquity (4th -6th century AD).

## Poster 3 & Digital presentation - Linguistic Analysis in the **Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine** Project

**Christine Roughan (New York University), Christopher B. Zeichmann (Toronto Metropolitan University), Michael L. Satlow (Brown University)**

*Abstract:* 

The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine (IIP) project presents a digital corpus of inscriptions from Israel and Palestine dating between the sixth century BCE and the seventh century CE. As of April 2023, this corpus includes 5,282 inscriptions encoded in EpiDoc-compliant XML, an example of which can be seen in the XML excerpt to the right. Four languages comprise the bulk of the corpus: 2,941 of these inscriptions contain Greek, 1,739 contain Aramaic, 457 contain Hebrew, and 262 contain Latin. Other languages (Phoenician, Classical Armenian, Syriac, Arabic, and Georgian) are represented in smaller amounts.

## Poster 4 & Digital presentation - When epigraphy meets linguistics. The semantic annotation of modality in the Latin inscriptions of the Republican age.

**Francesca Dell’Oro, Helena Bermúdez Sabel, Pauline Jacsont**

*Abstract:* 
Modality – i.e., the expression of the notions of necessity, possibility and volition in a language – is today a thriving research field in linguistics. The WoPoss corpus is being set up and annotated with the goal of investigating modality in the history of the Latin language through literary and documentary texts. This poster outlines the new release of the WoPoss corpus, including now 74 inscriptions. This recent achievement crucially enriches the WoPoss corpus and complies with its aim of being a representative corpus in terms of sociolinguistic variables. Moreover, it enhances epigraphic research, by providing a fine-grained semantic analysis which is still rare even on literary texts.

In the poster we outline the whole pipeline along with the sequence of necessary file conversions, including the selection of the relevant Republican inscriptions to be (added and) retrieved from the EDR database, the automatic annotation of the files using the Stanza library for Python (adding lemmas, parts of speech, morphosyntactic description, and syntactic dependencies), the manual semantic annotation, the validation of the final files against the WoPoss project’s schemas and how the corpus can be accessed through the dedicated interface https://woposs.unine.ch/search. 

Acknowledgements: This new release is the result of a close cooperation between the Epigraphic Database Rome project and the SNSF-funded project A World of Possibilities (PI: Francesca Dell’Oro). It was made possible by an EAGLE-IDEA bursary granted to Mrs. Pauline Jacsont.

## Poster - EpiSearch. Epigraphic Manuscripts and Digital Humanities.

**Tatiana Tommasi**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>*Abstract:*</summary>

EpiSearch is a collaborative pilot project that explores the possibilities offered by technologies deployed in the field of the Digital Humanities to recover the data found in the so-called epigraphic manuscripts and to link them to the main online epigraphic databases existing today (EDR, EDH, EDCS, PHI). Epigraphic manuscripts, consisting of handwritten transcriptions made by erudites in post-classical times, are of fundamental value because they preserve the only record for textual sources that have not survived in their physical form. Despite their importance, epigraphic manuscripts have seldom received sufficient scholarly attention; moreover, until now they have never been studied through a digital approach. The EpiSearch project aims at bridging this gap.

To reach this goal the EpiSearch team is working on a case study: an epigraphic manuscript written in Venice in the early 1700s by a local antiquarian, Giovanni Antonio Astori. This study is intended as a proof of concept, in view of a future large-scale and collaborative research plan. 
The project has so far included three main steps.

The first one explores the possibilities offered by Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) to study epigraphic manuscripts.
The second encompasses designing an integrated system, created by collecting data from the main online epigraphic databases; this will give us the possibility to match the inscriptions that are transcribed in the manuscript with their edition in digital resources.
The last step will produce a digital application to browse a visually annotated version of the manuscript with hyperlinks to the online epigraphic databases for connecting the transcriptions of inscriptions with their current digital editions.

The EpiSearch team includes Federico Boschetti: Institute for Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli” – National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ILC), Pisa / Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH), Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Lorenzo Calvelli, PI: Department of Humanities and VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Franz Fischer: Department of Humanities and VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Daniele Fusi: VeDPH, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Silvia Orlandi: Sapienza University of Rome; Thea Sommerschield: Department of Humanities, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice; Tatiana Tommasi: Department of Humanities, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice.
