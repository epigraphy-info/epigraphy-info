### Attendance

We kindly ask you to visit the [Doodle Poll](https://doodle.com/poll/gmmuqbvpsrtwwqgc) and register either your attendance or one of the other two options by September 24th.

### Preliminary programme

The Preliminary programme can be found here. Your input is very welcome, so, please, feel free to send us your suggestions (the deadline for suggestions is August 6th). As agreed in the first epigraphy.info workshop (see in detail in [http://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00024397](http://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00024397){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} the main topic of this one should be the demonstration of a prototype web application of an editor and a search mechanism, but other issues will be addressed as well.

### Travel and accommodation

**Travel**

The best way to travel to and from Zadar is by plane and/or by bus; unfortunately, there are no trains leading to Zadar, but there are many buses from Zagreb to Zadar, and the drive takes approximately 3 and a half hours.
There are some direct flights to Zadar either by major airline companies or the low-budget ones; however, most of them usually fly on certain days only (e.g. Mondays and Fridays) so perhaps you won't find them convenient; thus it would perhaps be best to fly to Zagreb (which has more direct lines) and then proceed by bus.
Bus lines are quite frequent and you can find timetables at [https://voznired.akz.hr/](https://voznired.akz.hr/?lang=en) (for departures from Zagreb to Zadar) or [http://www.liburnija-zadar.hr/](http://www.liburnija-zadar.hr/linije.php?tip=4&polaziste=01&odrediste=Z+A+G+R+E+B&lang=en) (for departures from Zadar to Zagreb). You can also check the following companies: [https://getbybus.com/hr/autobus-zagreb](https://getbybus.com/hr/autobus-zagreb) and [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.com).

**Accommodation**

During the second half of September many hotels and hostels are still booked solid or have only a few rooms left; however, there are plenty of excellent, good and decent apartments or other types of accommodation near the venue where one could find a place to stay (at a reasonable price) so we are positive that you would find a place of your pleasing; we recommend browsing booking.com (places near the University in the old town centre) and looking for places with at least three stars and with the booking.com rating of at least 7.5 and upwards.

In addition, we are glad to inform you that the University could provide a subsidized accommodation (120 kn [app. 16 €] per night per person) at the University dormitory (either in the facilities at Ul. Dr. Franje Tuđmana 24 d or at Trg kneza Višeslava 9) for a maximum of four persons (two two-bed apartments) – if they won't mind sharing apartments – so we kindly ask those who might be interested in that option to send an application to the Steering committee members together with a brief explanation of their request. The dead-line for the application is August 6th.
