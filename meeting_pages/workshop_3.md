You can also get around the city easily by hiring a Citybike. And it’s free! For more information, please visit: [https://www.citybikewien.at/en/](https://www.citybikewien.at/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### How to get into the city centre
At the airport [http://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers/arriving_passenger](http://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers/arriving_passenger){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

#### From the airport
* By train: there are two train services available. The CAT (one way €11; return €19) and the considerably cheaper suburban railway line S7 (timetable as pdf). As the airport is outside the Vienna city limits, you will need two tickets: one for the zone up to the Vienna city limits for €1.80 and a ticket for the Vienna city zone for €2.40 available at the vending machines at the station. Vienna-Card or holders of multi-day tickets (Wiener Linien) need ONLY one single ticket for the Vienna outer zone (€1.80). Please validate the ticket before starting your journey.

* By bus
There are also regional buses connecting the airport with the city centre (one way €8; return €13).

* By taxi
There are different taxi/limousine services that can be booked online and bring you directly to your destination. Approx. price: 30-45€.

* From the railway or bus station
Metro lines, trams and buses of the Wiener Linien take you from any train or bus station to any other place in the city.

If you will be using public transport frequently, we suggest the purchase of a weekly pass (€17.10, valid from Monday to the following Monday 9am), but 24-,48- and 72-hour tickets are also available. The fare for a single trip is €2.40. Tickets are valid on all public transport lines within Vienna's Zone 100.

* By car
As tolls are compulsory on all motorways and expressways in Austria, you will need a vignette to use Vienna's city motorways. You can find detailed information on the toll charges here. Some of Vienna's districts are entirely short-stay parking zones. In districts 1 to 9 and 20, you will need to purchase a parking ticket from Monday to Friday (except on public holidays) between 9.00 am and 10.00 pm. In districts 10 to 12 and 14 to 18, short-stay parking zones apply from Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays) from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm. [more details]. We strongly recommend the option of Park & Ride.
