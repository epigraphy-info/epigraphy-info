## Call for papers & posters 

*Call for papers and posters has been closed, the programme is being finalised and will be released by the end of February* 

The *eighth Epigraphy.info workshop* will take place in **Berlin (Germany)**, from **3-5 April 2024**, hosted by the *Department of Digital History at the Humboldt University of Berlin*, and with the courtesy of the *Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW)*.

We are planning an **open meeting** to discuss and try different tools related to Digital Epigraphy. If you are already part of the Epigraphy.info community or just interested in Digital Epigraphy, we warmly invite you to come to our meeting in Berlin. During the workshop, we will explain the objectives and expectations of Epigraphy.info and invite new members to get involved. The meeting is ideally planned as an in-person event, especially to present a paper or poster, but you can attend and discuss remotely. We might record some of the presentations and talks and later make them available via the [Epigraphy.info Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/epigraphy-info) and place the posters on the Epigraphy.info website.

The meeting will include **presentations** and **training sessions**. Part of it will be related to current Digital Epigraphy projects worldwide and we encourage scholars who work on Digital Epigraphy to present **proposals** adapted to a wide variety of formats:

- **Panels** for those scholars who want to discuss a topic or have a specific agenda. We will provide space to promote academic discussion.

- **Papers** for scholars who want to present their project or results of a Project Research.

- **Posters** to present news, education projects, updates on existing projects etc.

- **Hands-on sessions.** We are exploring different options such as hackathons, and presentations of a new tool followed by training (20 minutes presentation + 20 minutes training). If a group thinks it would be useful for the community, we encourage to present a proposal. If you would like to provide more extended training, please, reach out, so we can accommodate you.


For those interested, please send your abstract (around 200 words for papers and posters, 400 words for panels and hands-on sessions) before November 30th to the Steering Committee at info@epigraphy.info. We will notify selected participants and circulate a provisional program by the end of December.
