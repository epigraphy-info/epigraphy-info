# ENCODE/Epigraphy.info VII Workshop in Leuven

The *seventh ENCODE/Epigraphy.info workshop* will be taking place between **Monday April 24 and Wednesday April 26 2023 in Leuven**.

The event will be held primarily as in-person meeting, at the campus of KU Leuven’s Faculty of Arts, but we plan for some combination of a hybrid format for participants that would otherwise be prevented from attending.

* Monday *April 24th*: **ENCODE** in-person training sessions on EpiDoc (focus on Mycenean inscriptions) and the READ (Research Environment for Ancient Documents) platform + Epigraphy.info poster session (followed by a reception at 17:30 CET)

### Morning session: EpiDoc for Mycenaean texts (trainers: Gabriel Bodard, Federico Aurora, Alice Bencivenni & Marta Fogagnolo)
Mycenaean Greek texts (ca. 1350-1150) are written in a syllabary that we call Linear B. In scholarly editions they are usually transcribed using latin letters and a system (Wingspread Conventions) similar to, but not identical with, the Leiden Conventions. Digital encoding of Mycenaean texts (as in the online databases DAMOS and LiBER), at the moment, has not made use of EpiDoc. However, to facilitate work on Mycenaean inscriptions to conform to FAIR principles (e.g. to make exchange and reuse of data by other epigraphical databases easier) work on the alignment of [EpiDoc with Mycenaean usage](https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/app-epi-mycenaean.html) {:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was recently started and published as an appendix to the EpiDoc-guidelines. 

The workshop will be a hands-on, collaborative, group work on completing the alignment of EpiDoc with the Wingspread Conventions, with the aim – in addition to provide a new encoding tool for Mycenologists – of giving and in-depth picture of the workings of EpiDoc and how it can be adapted to different epigraphic traditions.

Participants are required to get acquainted with the basics of EpiDoc and of Myceanean transcription beforehand (material will be provided to successful applicants).

### Afternoon session: working with inscriptions in the READ environment (trainer: Stephen White)
READ (Research Environment for Ancient Documents) is an open source software system supporting the scholarly study of ancient texts on their physical carriers. It provides editing facilities for philology and at its basic level allows the researcher to link images of a scribed object with a transcription of the text represented. It is capable of handling multiple transcriptions of the same object in parallel. This workshop will introduce the researcher to the basic workflows in READ for linking original-language texts to transcriptions with the specific goal of demonstrating READ's paleographic features.

Attending this workshop should give the participants:
1. A basic understanding of the READ workspace
2. The ability to add an image to a READ text
3. The ability to add an transcription to a READ text
4. The ability to annotate boundaries of glyphs on the image
5. The ability to link transcription to the glyphs on the image
6. The ability to navigate the paleography report generated by READ

This workshop will be accessing READ through participants personal computer through a web connection. It will use a supplied image and transcription. Participants can indicate in the registration form if they would like to possibly use their own example. Note that using your own text will require more work on the participant. The version of READ we will use in this workshop will handle text in Latin, Greek or Coptic.


* Tuesday *April 25th*: **Epigraphy.info** workshop + (optional) social dinner (19:00 CET)

* Wednesday *April 26th*: **Epigraphy.info** workshop + (optional) social event (visit to a museum, 13:30-17:00 CET)

*If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Epigraphy.info committee ([info@epigraphy.info](mailto:info@epigraphy.info)).*

We are happy to inform you that IDEA (the International Digital Epigraphy Association) decided to sponsor early career scholars who are going to participate in the next Epigraphy.info event.

## Poster Session (in-person)

The Leuven workshop will host an physical in-person session dedicated to the presentation of new and ongoing projects in the field of Digital Epigraphy. The posters will be also displayed on the Epigraphy.info website during the workshop and after. Should you wish to record a 5-minute video about your project, we will host them on the Epigraphy.info Youtube channel.

#### Posters Guidelines

Posters may include text, images, graphs as well as videos and audio. You can prepare your poster in the format that you find more suitable (PDF, PowerPoint, .mp4, .mpg, avi.).
The only rule is: **keep it short!**

For PDF you should limit your documentation to a single page (ideally 1080 x 1536 px), PowerPoint presentation should include no more than 3 slides.
The maximum duration of a video is 5 minutes.
Please send us your E-Poster via a file transfer website (like WeTransfer: [https://wetransfer.com/](https://wetransfer.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or Smash: [https://fromsmash.com/](https://fromsmash.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

**Be creative!**

We want to make our poster session as effective and inclusive as possible: if you have any creative ideas or suggestions about formats or virtual rooms, please send us an email or write in the [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/epigraphyinfo){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and we will take them into consideration.

#### Deadline

In order to present a poster, please send a title and a short abstract to our committee by March 24th, 2023 ([info@epigraphy.info](mailto:info@epigraphy.info)). By March 31th, 2023 you will receive a notification from the steering committee whether your poster has been accepted. Posters should be submitted by April 18th, 2023.
