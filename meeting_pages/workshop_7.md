# ENCODE/Epigraphy.info VII Workshop (Leuven)

The *seventh ENCODE/Epigraphy.info workshop* will be taking place between **Monday April 24 and Wednesday April 26 2023 in Leuven**.

The event will be held primarily as in-person meeting, at the campus of KU Leuven’s [Faculty of Arts](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/english/contact){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but we plan for some combination of a hybrid format for participants that would otherwise be prevented from attending.

## Programme

You can check the full programme [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5qEP2b7K-2Jw4du-LNByuMELui5UIltDQFR0V0LjLU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. You can find more details about the ENCODE training sessions and the Epigraphy.info workshop below:

## Programme ENCODE training sessions

* Monday *April 24th*: **ENCODE** in-person training sessions on EpiDoc (focus on Mycenean inscriptions) and the READ (Research Environment for Ancient Documents) platform + Epigraphy.info poster session (followed by a reception at 18:00 CET)

#### Morning session: EpiDoc for Mycenaean inscriptions (trainers: Gabriel Bodard, Federico Aurora, Alice Bencivenni & Marta Fogagnolo)
Mycenaean Greek texts (ca. 1350-1150) are written in a syllabary that we call Linear B. In scholarly editions they are usually transcribed using latin letters and a system (Wingspread Conventions) similar to, but not identical with, the Leiden Conventions. Digital encoding of Mycenaean texts (as in the online databases DAMOS and LiBER), at the moment, has not made use of EpiDoc. However, to facilitate work on Mycenaean inscriptions to conform to FAIR principles (e.g. to make exchange and reuse of data by other epigraphical databases easier) work on the alignment of [EpiDoc with Mycenaean usage](https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/app-epi-mycenaean.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was recently started and published as an appendix to the EpiDoc-guidelines. 

The workshop will be a hands-on, collaborative, group work on completing the alignment of EpiDoc with the Wingspread Conventions, with the aim – in addition to provide a new encoding tool for Mycenologists – of giving and in-depth picture of the workings of EpiDoc and how it can be adapted to different epigraphic traditions.

Participants are required to get acquainted with the basics of EpiDoc and of Myceanean transcription beforehand (material will be provided to successful applicants).

#### Afternoon session: working with inscriptions in the READ environment (trainer: Stephen White)
READ (Research Environment for Ancient Documents) is an open source software system supporting the scholarly study of ancient texts on their physical carriers. It provides editing facilities for philology and at its basic level allows the researcher to link images of a scribed object with a transcription of the text represented. It is capable of handling multiple transcriptions of the same object in parallel. This workshop will introduce the researcher to the basic workflows in READ for linking original-language texts to transcriptions with the specific goal of demonstrating READ's paleographic features.

Attending this workshop should give the participants:
1. A basic understanding of the READ workspace
2. The ability to add an image to a READ text
3. The ability to add an transcription to a READ text
4. The ability to annotate boundaries of glyphs on the image
5. The ability to link transcription to the glyphs on the image
6. The ability to navigate the paleography report generated by READ

This workshop will be accessing READ through participants personal computer through a web connection. It will use a supplied image and transcription. Participants can indicate in the registration form if they would like to possibly use their own example. Note that using your own text will require more work on the participant. The version of READ we will use in this workshop will handle text in Latin, Greek or Coptic.
