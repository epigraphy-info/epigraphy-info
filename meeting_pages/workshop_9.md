The **ninth Epigraphy.info workshop** will take place in **Aarhus (Denmark)** from **2-4 April 2025**. The workshop will be hosted by the [Past Social Network Project](https://projects.au.dk/pastnetworks) and the [Social Resilience Lab](https://cas.au.dk/en/social-resilience-lab), Department of History and Classical Studies at Aarhus University, supported by the [Center for Humanities Computing](https://chc.au.dk/), and by [The Museum of Ancient Art](https://antikmuseet.au.dk/en/), Aarhus University.
