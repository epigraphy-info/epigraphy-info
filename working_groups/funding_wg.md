## WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO

The Funding Working Group consists of a team of seven Epigraphy.info members affiliated to different institutions in different countries. The group has an intermediary role between the community and the Steering Committee, which will have to approve the decisions.

**The tasks of the group are:**

* figure out and manage possibilities for funding in order to cover the needs of the Epigraphy.info community and of its partners
* help you find the best solution for your digital epigraphy project and find technical support
* provide advice by writing proposals, which are in line with the Epigraphy.info guidelines and best practices

## YOU CAN ADDRESS OUR TEAM IF
* you are already part of the Epigraphy.info community and you are exploring a way to fund your digital epigraphy initiatives
* you are starting a digital epigraphy project and you need advice on how to coordinate your work with the Epigraphy.info community
* you need a letter of intent for your application

**We will do our best to help you!**
