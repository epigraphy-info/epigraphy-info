The Working Group is tasked to 'clean-up' vocabularies created by the [EAGLE Europeana project](https://www.eagle-network.eu/resources/vocabularies/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} between 2013 and 2015. An informal working group was established during the [5th Epigraphy.info workshop]({{ "workshop_5/" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}_ in November 2020 and continued its work in 2021. From 2022, the work of the Vocabularies group was partially carried by the FAIR Epigraphy Project (2022-2025). For details see the FAIR Epigraphy website at [https://inscriptiones.org/](https://inscriptiones.org/). For the latest update on their activities, see the [digital poster presented in Berlin in April 2024](https://epigraphy.info/workshop_8_posters/#poster7). The next online meeting will happen in late April/early May 2024 and we will discuss the FAIR vocabularies proposal and the next steps of the group.

**If you have questions, or if you would like to contribute to the discussion, please contact Petra Hermankova at petra.hermankova@uni-mainz.de.**

## Goals 

The EAGLE vocabularies themselves are unfinished and incomplete (for multiple reasons, including resources and the extent of community participation beyond the epigraphy of the Roman Empire), and a fully developed set of community data standards, applicable to all ancient epigraphic cultures, is now required as a pre-requisite to any successful integration into the web of data using the framework prototyped by EpiOnt (for details see the [Ontology Working Group page]({{ "ontologies_wg/"| relative_url }}){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"})._

The aim of the working group was to conceptually work on defining the 'type of inscription' to be better fit for the digital corpora of the 21st century, while building on the tradition and keeping the best and <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="blank">FAIR principles</a> of the epigraphic discipline and the work done by the [EAGLE Europeana project](https://www.eagle-network.eu/resources/vocabularies/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
