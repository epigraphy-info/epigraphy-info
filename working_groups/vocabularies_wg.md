# Technical WG 2 - Eagle Vocabularies

The Working Group is tasked to 'clean-up' vocabularies created by the [Eagle Europeana project](https://www.eagle-network.eu/resources/vocabularies/) between 2013 and 2015. Many large-scale epigraphic projects are using Eagle vocabularies but they consist some inconsistencies and duplicates that need to be resolved.

## Current goals in 2021

The working group is currently working on conceptually defining the 'type of inscription' to be better fit for the digital corpora of the 21st century, while building on the tradition and keeping the best practices of the epigraphic discipline and the work done by the Eagle Europeana project. If you would like to contribute to the discussion, we'll be glad if you can join us! We meet regularly on Fridays (16.00 CET) over Zoom.
