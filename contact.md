#### The technology behind the scene

We are using a custom Jekyll theme - Centrarium, made by [Ben Centra](https://github.com/bencentra). Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium). You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
